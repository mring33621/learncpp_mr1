## Learning Cpp, Step 1

I have decided to learn C++.
This repo contains some simple string handling exercises, culminating with a Soundex implementation.
When I was teaching myself Java, in the late 1990's, the first thing I did was write a Soundex implementation.
I thought it would be a good place to start with C++.

Environment:
- Windows 11
- Jetbrains CLion Nova
- C++ 17
- CXX compiler identification is GNU 13.1.0
